##User Management Web Application##
The User Management Web Application is a simple yet functional web-based system designed to allow users to view, add, edit, and delete user details through an intuitive and responsive interface. The project is built using React.js (with Vite for fast development) and interacts with the mock backend API provided by JSONPlaceholder. This application serves as a practical demonstration of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a front-end web environment.

Key Features:
User Listing:

Displays a list of users with key details such as ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, and Department.
Supports pagination for improved usability.
User Management:

Add Users: Fill out a form to add new users.
Edit Users: Update existing user details with ease.
Delete Users: Remove users with a single click.
Backend Integration:

Utilizes JSONPlaceholder's /users endpoint to simulate data fetching and manipulation.
Handles API responses efficiently, ensuring a smooth user experience.
Error Handling:

Displays appropriate messages for failed API calls and other issues.
Ensures validation checks to prevent invalid data submission.
Responsive UI:

Built with a clean and mobile-friendly layout using React components and CSS styling to enhance usability across devices.
Technologies Used:
Front-end: React.js (Vite for project setup and performance optimization)
Backend API: JSONPlaceholder (Mock REST API for demonstration purposes)
Styling: CSS/Flexbox for responsive design
State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
HTTP Requests: Axios for API communication
Version Control: Git and GitHub for source code management
Deployment: Vercel for hosting and deployment

Challenges Faced & Future Improvements:
Challenges:

Managing API limitations of JSONPlaceholder, as it doesn't store data persistently.
Ensuring proper state management when handling user edits and deletes.
Future Improvements:

Integrate a real backend API for persistent data storage.
Implement authentication and role-based access control.
Enhance UI with better design elements and animations.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
